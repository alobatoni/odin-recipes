    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Making sourdough bread might seem like a complex process due to the fact that making it does take up some time, but it actually is really simple once you get a strong <a href="https://www.theclevercarrot.com/2019/03/beginner-sourdough-starter-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">sourdough starter</a>. 
        This self fermented bread not only tastes good but it's also better for your gut compared to other types of bread. Once you master this basic recipe, you'll be able to make whatever flavor you can think of!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients Needed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Active sourdough starter</li>
        <li>All purpose flour</li>
        <li>Warm filtered water</li>
        <li>sea salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Add warm filtered water</strong></li> 
        <p>Add 375g of warm filtered water into a big bowl. Make sure it's not hot. Slightly warm water will help the fermentation process speed up little bit.</p>
        

        <li><strong>Add active sourdough starter</strong></li> 
        <p>Into the same bowl, add 100g of your active sourdough starter. I recommend using it once it has started to deflate, approximately around 1cm to 2cm below it's peaked state (this is around 3-4 hours after it's been fed).</p>
        <p><em>Make sure it floats!</em></p>
        

        <li><strong>Add your flour and salt</strong></li> 
        <p>Add 515g of all purpose flour (you can also use 500g of bread flour instead), and 11g of sea salt. </p>
        

        <li><strong>Mix</strong></li> 
        <p>Mix Everything in the bowl for five minutes, you can start with a fork and then switch to your clean hands.</p>
        
        

        <li><strong>Rest the dough</strong></li> 
        <p>Cover the bowl with a plate or plastic wrap and let the dough rest on the counter for 2 hours.</p>
        

        <li><strong>Stretch and folds</strong></li> 
        <p>After the 2 hour rest, wet your hands and grab it by the edge, stretch it carefully without tearing, and fold it on top of itself. Next rotate the bowl 90° and repeat by grabbing a different edge, rotate and repeat about 10 times. After this, cover the bowl and let it rest for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes repeat the stretch and folds,
          only this time doing it around 4 times or until the dough doesn't stretch any more. Cover the dough for 30 minutes and repeat the process two more times, meaning a total of 4 stretch and fold sessions over the course of two hours.
        </p>
        

        <li><strong>Rest the dough</strong></li> 
        <p>Cover the dough for 2 hours and let the fermentation process double the size of the dough. By the end, the dough should be jiggly and filled with bubbles.
        </p>
        

        <li><strong>Shape the dough</strong></li> 
        <p>Cover a clean surface with flour and flip the bowl over it, the dough should unstick by itself and fall. Grab edge by edge, stretching the dough without tearing it, and form a rectangle. 
          Fold the dough by grabbing one side and putting it in the middle and the the opposite and folding it right on top. Grab the end and roll the dough. If the dough is too sticky you can add flour by spreading it on the surface as well as on the dough.
          Create tension on the surface of the dough by moving in around on the counter (not rolling) in a candy cane shaped motion, meaning, push the dough away from you and then back towards you. Do this movement a few times until its shaped smoothly into a ball, make sure you stop right before the surface starts to tear.
          After this, let ir rest on the counter for 15 minutes with plastic wrap covering it, make sure there's flour on the surface of the dough so that the plastic doesn't stick to it. 
        </p>
        

        <li><strong>Reshape and cold proof the dough</strong></li> 
        <p>After the 15 minutes, remove the plastic and repeat the previous step, except this time the initial rectangle should be smaller now that the dough is more stiff. Instead of letting it rest for 15 minutes, grab a bowl and place a clean kitchen towel, one that's big enough to cover the dough completely, inside the bowl and put flour of over it. Carefully place your dough over the towel inside your bowl upside down (smooth side facing down)
          sprinkle some flour on top and cover the dough with the towel. Refrigerate your dough over night.
        </p>
        

        <li><strong>Score and bake</strong></li> 
        <p> The next day preheat your oven at 230°c for 45 minutes with your baking pan inside. Before baking, take your dough out of the fridge and place it on your parchment paper by flipping it right side up. Next, score your dough by grabbing a very sharp knife and cutting the surface with one vertical line and one horizontal line across.
          Take your baking pan out of the oven and put your bread in, cover it by placing another deep baking pan on top acting as a lid (use a dutch oven instead of pans if you have one). Place the dough in the oven for 20-30 minutes and then remove the lid and lower the temperature to 200°c, bake it for another 10-20 minutes.
        </p>
        

        <li><strong>Final step</strong></li> 
        <p> Once it's done baking and the crust looks golden, remove it from the oven and let it cool down on a cooling rack for an hour before cutting.
        </p>
